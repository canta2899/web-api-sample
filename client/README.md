# Client example

The client is automatically generated using [swagger-typescript-api](https://github.com/acacode/swagger-typescript-api).

Install dependencies by running

```bash
npm install 
```

Then run the following in order to generate the client (ensure the API is running)

```bash
npm run gen
```

The `index.ts` script can be executed with `npm run start`.
